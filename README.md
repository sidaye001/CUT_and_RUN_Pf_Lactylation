# CUT_and_RUN_Pf_Lactylation
**This repository is to show all the analysis of CUT&RUN data for Lactylation epigenetic markers in Plasmodium falciparum.The analysis are as follows:**

- Preprocessing steps
- Macs2 pipeline to call peaks
- CSAW pipeline to call peaks
- gene peak assignment for protein-coding genes in P. falciparum
- gene peak assignment for lncRNA in P. falciparum
- Differential binding analysis for 8mM vs 0.5mM lactylation treatment by CSAW method
- Figures

**Running the code:**

To install the code please clone the library by copy-pasting the following in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/sidaye001/CUT_and_RUN_Pf_Lactylation.git


**Data availability**
The processed data is available here and can be used to run the analysis pipeline smoothly and generate the figures in the paper. We suggest that you save the rds folder within the same directory where the code is cloned. Alternatively, change the relative path in the code.
